## Part 2 Tasks

•	**MAKE:** This week you will revisit and re-imagine your annotations from the previous module. Working either individually or in self-selected teams of up to three people, your task is to take what you've learned and re-present it in a new format. That format is entirely up to you: it can be something digital like a meme, gif, or digital story; it can be something you've built, drawn, knit, or baked; it can be something that has a performative element; or, some other approach not mentioned here. Your job is to think about what you've learned and to engage it from a different direction. Do not obsess too much about the end product and whether it is perfect or not; the primary objective is to engage in the process, to think about the choices you're making and why you're making them, and to consider how this process helps us understand the text in a new way. 

•	**POST** your project in your Webcourses discussion board.

•	**REFLECT:** In 300-400 words, reflect on your process through these two modules: How did you decide what you would annotate? How did you decide which of your annotations to use for your project? What were the key decisions that you made and how did you decide to approach them? How did these processes help you to understand the text differently? How does your work speak to Pratt's definition of the contact zone?
