## Native American Contact, Removal, and Resistance

This two-week module focuses on the following texts:

•	The Cherokee Memorials (1829)

•	William Apess, "An Indian's Looking Glass for the White Man" (1833)

•	Excerpts from Black Hawk's Autobiography (1833)

*“[Contact zones] refer to social spaces where cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other  [… It is] the space of colonial encounters, the space in which peoples geographically and historically separated come into contact with each other and establish ongoing relations, usually involving conditions of coercion, radical inequality, and intractable conflict. […]  By using the term ‘contact,’ I aim to foreground the interactive, improvisational dimensions of colonial encounters so easily ignored or suppressed by diffusionist accounts of conquest and domination. A ‘contact’ perspective emphasizes how subjects are constituted in and by their relations to each other. It treats the relations among colonizer and colonized, or travelers and ‘travelees,’ not in terms of separateness or apartheid, but in terms of copresence, interaction, interlocking understandings and practices.”--Mary Louise Pratt, “The Arts of the Contact Zone”*

*"I write thus, sir, to inform you of the state of mind these Indian tidings have awakened here, and to pray with one voice more that you, whose hands are strong with the delegated power of fifteen millions of men, will avert with that might the terrific injury which threatens the Cherokee tribe." –An excerpt from Ralph Waldo Emerson's [Letter to US President Martin Van Buren, April 23, 1838](https://www.bartleby.com/90/1103.html)*

The Native American texts you’ll encounter this week echo much of what we discussed during the first week of class. Some of our readings will feel like history, some may feel like religion, and some will read like legal documents. As was the case with those earlier writers, these varied literary forms make sense if you consider the context in which they are written.

Most of the Native American literature that we will read for this module was written down in the early- to mid-19th century, during the age of Manifest Destiny and Indian Removal policy.  As you may remember from your history classes, Manifest Destiny emphasized the sacred mission of the United States to expand across the North American continent.  In practical terms, such a policy also meant the “removal” and relocation of Native American populations all over the country. Given this context, it makes sense that Native American literature produced during this period is centered on claiming a voice, space, and (hi)story. These writers are not only serving as witnesses, but they are documenting what happened and are testifying, or making arguments, in response. Ralph Waldo Emerson's letter, which I have excerpted at the start of this module and which you can read in full [here,](https://www.bartleby.com/90/1103.html) serves as a plea to then-US President Martin Van Buren, asking him to use his power on behalf of the Cherokee people.

As you move through these readings, keep in mind Pratt’s definition of the contact zone, which I’ve included at the beginning of this module. These writers are engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the United States government, and it is important for us to think about how they are structuring their arguments in response—or, how the two sides are “negotiating” their “shared space.” Through this dialogue, we should continue to examine the ways that American literature is developing and how these writers are also pushing us to (re)consider what it means to write American literature, or, what it means (or has meant) to be American.
