## Part 1 Tasks

•	**READ:** [Apess](https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/aml3031/chapter/wiliam-apes/), [Cherokee Memorials](https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/aml3031/chapter/the-cherokee-memorials/), [Black Hawk](https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/aml3031/chapter/black-hawk-autobiography/)

•	**SIGN UP** for a [Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/) account; we will use this feature at various times in the semester, so please use a name that will be easy for me to identify for grading purposes. 

•	**ANNOTATE:** Choose two items (from at least two of this week's readings) to annotate. Your annotations can be wide ranging: they might include unfamiliar names, places, or events; or, it might simply be something that sounds interesting or confusing and you aren't sure why. Make sure to include a citation so that we can see where your information came from and remember to use quotation marks around anything that has been quoted directly.
