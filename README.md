# CM Week 13: Native American Literature: Contact, Removal, and Resistance

This sample assignment from an American Literature survey (the "Beginnings to 1865") focuses on three Native-American texts published between 1829 and 1833. The brief lecture, accompanied by two sample assignments, gives students an opportunity to engage with the texts in ways that are geared towards critical pedagogy and critical making. Students will conduct research, reflect on their learning processes, and then connect that learning to the texts and their larger contexts.
